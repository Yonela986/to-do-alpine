Add ability to edit todos
add ability to filter todos


** setup some conditions for the user input when edding input in the list(
    avoid entering empty array or empty space
).
x-show - let us show and hide DOM elements
x-data -so we set up userInput for data meaning user will be able to add text on our text holder
x-text - if we set this to userInput, means whenever I type something on text area it will also show below as a textt being edited.

        x-data declare a new Alpine component and its data for a block of html 
        - modifiers can modify the behavior of directives
        - default- prevent the default behaviour
        - x-model synchronize a piece of data with an input element

         <!--add click event using x-on:-->
        <!--add our object and what we want our click to actually do-->
        <!-- by adding userInput we reinitializing user input

         <!---x-text sets the text content of an element based on a JS expression
            <p x-text="userInput"></p> --->
            <!--x-for is used to iterate over a list-->
        <!-- x-bind sets HTML attributes based on the result of JS expressions-->
        <!--the filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function-->
        <!--currTodo - current to do-->
         <!--Only want to show this button when we have todo on our list, for that
            will use x-show -->
